# Game Creator

The idea was to create an app to enable people to make their own versions of the game that is featured in the very popular show on YouTube [Jet Lag: The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxLgmsmvXOE&list=PLB7ZcpBcwdC4SeH7qNw05wgU03HlRGiiS). The idea is that the app shows markers on a map that would be tasks the players need to complete. A game itself can be very local, in a town for example or as large as the world.

The app is intended to be used by those who enjoy these sorts of real life adventure type games.

# How to use
1. On the top right you will see a square. Hover your mouse over it and a login window will pop-up
2. Enter the following email: **testi@testi.com**, password: **1234** (Very secure)
3. Now you should be able to see the added markers. To view the info click on the marker.
4. To add a new marker write at least a name for the marker in the left box. Description is optional.
5. Move the map around by dragging and scrolling for zoom until you're in the desired location you want to add the marker and click on the map. This should have now added a new marker. **NOTE: All markers are visible to everyone in this version so we would strongly advise you to not place a marker with location and/or info you might not want others to see!**
6. To delete a marker click on the marker and push the **Delete** button inside the pop-up. **Please only delete markers you have added. Don't delete markers others have placed!**
